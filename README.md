# HomeCook
HomeCook is an application that allows the user to search for recipes based on ingredients in their pantry. The application uses accounts to store saved recipes for use at a later time. HomeCook promotes eating home cooked meals which are often more cost effective and healthy than take-out. It also reduces waste of grocery items that you may just not know what to do with.
